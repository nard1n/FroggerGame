![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)

Frogger is a retro grid-based arcade game built in vanilla JavaScript, HTML and CSS.

The object of the game is to direct the frog from the starting point to its home by crossing a busy road and a river by jumping on the passing logs. It is timed and displays to the user when they succeed or lose.
